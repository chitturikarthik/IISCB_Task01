Extremly sorry for not containerizing the web application.
The frontend code is present in the client folder and backend code is present in the server folder.

For Frontend -
    1.Install and setup node.js on your local machine from  https://nodejs.org/en
    2.Once you have Node.js installed in your local machine ,  navigate to client folder through terminal 
        cd client
        npm install --- to install all the needed packages
        npm run dev -- to run the frontend

For Backend - 
    1.Make sure that local machine has Python installed.
    2.Navigate to server folder and run the below commands.
        cd server
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python main.py

That's it , you are ready to use the web application .
